<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About

[![Digital Ontario Lease Form][product-screenshot]](https://vue-housing-prototype.netlify.app/)

This app prototype was made during a two-day hackathon at Civic Tech Toronto. I worked alongside a cross-functional team of lawyers and researchers. The idea was to take Ontarios official tenant/landlord lease (which is currently a PDF), and create a digital app for it. The benefits to landlords and tenants would be plentify. For example, tenants could log in at any time to see the agreement, and they wouldn't have to worry about losing the paper copy. Tenants would also have piece of mind knowing that the landlord is unable to manipulate the agreement in any way. Landlords would be able to safely store all their leases in one centralized place, and they wouldn't have to deal with paper forms anymore.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

If this is a Node.js app, please check package.json for an "enginees" attribute, wherein the Node and npm version may be specified. If so, I also include a "volta" attrbiute in the package.json. If you have the [Volta JavaScript Tool Manager](https://volta.sh/) installed, it will automatically install and run the appropriate version of Node.js.

- Check your node version
  ```sh
  node -v
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:adamsimonini/vue-housing.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm i
   ```
3. Run dev server
